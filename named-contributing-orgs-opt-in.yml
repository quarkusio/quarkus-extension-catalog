# This file is to record opt-ins for companies and organisations to be listed as sponsors and contributors on extension pages
# See https://quarkus.io/extensions/io.quarkus/quarkus-resteasy-reactive for an example of what is shown

# Including a company in these list should be done (or approved) by someone from that company

# What's a sponsor? A sponsor is an organisation or group of organisations that make a big enough contribution to an extension that they're sponsoring it.
# A sponsor can be listed in an individual extension's `quarkus-extension.yml`, but if there isn't one there, we try to guess.
# We won't show a guess without an opt-in, which is the function of this list.
named-sponsors:
  - Red Hat
  - Microsoft
  - KSM Technology Partners
  - Melloware Inc

# Most extensions have contributions from *many* organisations, which is the beauty of open source communities.
# Not every contributing company is a sponsor, but we also want to list every contributing organisation.
# We won't list an organisation without an opt-in.
# Any organisation that opts in as a sponsor will also be shown on charts of contributors
# To be shown in the charts, but *not* ever listed as a sponsor, an organisation should add its name to this list
